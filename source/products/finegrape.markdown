This black ostrich-leather box bag takes a satirical swipe at materialism in the age of social media. An exquisite hand-embroidered tapestry - which took over 150 hours to create - details the front, stitched onto fine English wool, but peer a little closer to discover the irony-steeped hashtag within.

Genuine gold threads bring a flicker of light, while a cadmium-red lamb-leather lining makes an opulent finishing touch. This piece comes accompanied by two interchangeable shoulder straps - one leather, one chain - as well as an elegant top handle for versatility, and may be secured using the functional lock and key. Inside, a zipped pocket provides practicality, while the hand-stitched label cements the designerâ€™s flawless attention to detail.
