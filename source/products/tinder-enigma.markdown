A dystopian love story plays out across the front of this exquisite dark-red eel leather box bag. Hand-stitched embroidery using real gold thread illustrates the contrast between classic and modern romance. Fine ruby and black-diamond beading plus a scattering of Swarovski crystals lends sparkle, while rabbit and mink-fur accents offer a tactile touch. 

This piece secures with a gold metal clasp. The functional keys swing to one side - and are accompanied by leather and gold metal interchangeable straps. The zipped interior pocket, complete with hand-stitched label, is a practical addition, while the cadmium-red lining is one of the designerâ€™s trademarks.
