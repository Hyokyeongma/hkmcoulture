The product of exquisite workmanship, this artisanal box bag is crafted from black ostrich leather on a gold metal frame. Hand-stitched embroidery using real silver and gold thread and black-diamond beading decorates the front: a tongue-in-cheek motif juxtaposing the grandeur of traditional transport methods with the convenience of todayâ€™s.

A functional clasp and key secures the design, while a single top handle and two interchangeable shoulder straps - one leather and one chain - offer versatility. The interior zipped pocket is a practical consideration, while a deep cherry-red, lamb-leather lining and hand-stitched label ensures a flawless finish.
