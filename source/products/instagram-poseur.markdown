We all know at least one Instagram Poseur. In this wit-injected creation, a collection of exquisite details blend ancient symbolism with contemporary cynicism. The red python base is adorned with hand-stitched embroidery and finished with genuine gold thread, black-diamond beading, mink fur and Swarovski stones.

Open the gold metal clasp to reveal the scarlet-red lamb-leather lining, including a zipped pocket and the designerâ€™s hand-stitched label - a beautiful calling card. Two interchangeable straps - one leather and one chain - ensure this piece is as practical as it is beautiful.
