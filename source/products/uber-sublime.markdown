In deep-blue python skin, this box bag blends traditional craftsmanship with a modern sense of irony. The front is adorned with a collection of appliqué and embroidery, which melds Ancient Egyptian iconography with a dose of contemporary wit. 

Genuine gold threads, black-diamond and ruby beads illuminate the supreme workmanship, while gold hardware forms a polished framework. The interior, lined with deep cherry-red lamb leather, hosts a zipped pocket and bears the designer’s hand-stitched label. Interchangeable leather and chain shoulder straps ensure day-to-night elegance, while functional keys swing by the side of the clasp.
