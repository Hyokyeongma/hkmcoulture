  ## HYO MA LONDON


  **"A handbag is not just a bag. For those who carry them, they are a small
  part of home, of the intimate sphere, brought into the outside. They contain
  all we really can’t live without, simultaneously intensely private and
  completely public. They are an extension of ourselves, and they have to be
  special".**


  HYO MA LONDON believes that by telling the unique story of each client in an
  artistic way and by standing for authenticity, transparency, and integrity
