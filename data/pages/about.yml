  ## Hyo Ma – The Designer


  Having grown up across continents, Hyo was destined to develop a sharp eye for
  global culture, an eye that informs her truly unique vision today. This young
  designer approaches each of her own couture creations with an innate awareness
  of local and international trends, seamlessly combined with the desires and
  tastes of each individual client.


  With the forthcoming launch of her own London-based brand, Hyo brings a fresh
  and witty approach to time-honoured artisanal crafts and breathes new life
  into the traditions of couture. Fine workmanship meets a touch of
  tongue-in-cheek wit to create truly unique pieces.


  Hyo’s career in design began in 2014, when she enrolled on the Foundation
  Diploma in Art and Design (Jewellery, Footwear & Fashion Accessories) at
  Central Saint Martins, graduating with a Distinction. Switching her focus from
  jewellery to textiles, she then undertook the BA(Hons) Textile Design course
  at Chelsea College of Arts, graduating with a First Class Honours. Hyo was
  also shortlisted from several hundred submissions globally in the prestigious
  Hand & Lock Prize for Embroidery in Textile Art.


  Enamoured by both the jewellery and textile worlds, Hyo brought elements of
  the two together by studying traditional embroidery techniques. Enrolling in
  the prestigious Royal School of Needlework at Hampton Court Palace, she
  dedicated her time to historical crafts, including Jacobean crewelwork, silk
  shading, canvaswork, canvas shading, stumpwork, goldwork, blackwork and
  applique. It is these time-honoured techniques that sit at the heart of Hyo’s
  work today.


  In 2016, Hyo began a coveted role assisting couturiers Ralph & Russo, a house
  where perfection in craft reigns supreme. Whilst working as a part of the
  team, Hyo spent thousands of hours honing her embroidery skills, collaborating
  on some of the design house’s most spectacular creations. She fell in love
  with the immense effort and acute attention to detail involved in producing
  breathtaking pieces.


  Every one of Hyo’s bespoke creations is the product of a close, personal
  collaboration with the client. From the framework to the final stitching,
  every detail is entirely unique to ensure a final product that is truly one of
  a kind and - just like the memories they capture - no two designs will ever be
  the same.
